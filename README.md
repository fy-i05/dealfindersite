# Title: Deal Finder

Description- This application has a webscraper in the main.py file with which I got data to fill my database with. I used Python to start with this first step because I didn't expect to want to create this into a larger project, just wanted to learn some more Python. Then I used SQLite3 for my database because it was built into the Python library. After getting all the necessary data, I used Django as a framework, JavaScript as the backend, and HTML/CSS for the front end. 

It was challenging to build the back-end as I had never made a full stack application before this, but it was rewarding to see small features work. I'm continuously building and working on this, so in the future, I hope to add all the Amazon categories to the side, including subcategories which will pop up once you click on the main category associated with the subcategories. Also, I want to add a sorting mechanism for best to worst deals as well as add more products. I can also definitely clean up the front-end design and make it look nicer but this was more of a project to learn to integrate a front-end with a back-end.

How to Run: If you download the project you should be able to run it by navigating to the directory where you have the project, then doing python manage.py runserver. From there it will give you a link to see the website.
